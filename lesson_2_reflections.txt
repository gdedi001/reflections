Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. The working directory is the folder that you are currently located in and the repository is a “box” that stores all commits of a file. The staging area is valuable because it allows you to select a certain amount of files to select before committing to the repository.
